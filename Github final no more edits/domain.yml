        🩺 **What is Diabetes?**

        Our cells depend on glucose (a simple sugar) for energy. When you eat, carbohydrates are converted into glucose and absorbed into the bloodstream. This signals the pancreas to release insulin, which helps cells absorb the glucose.

        **Diabetes mellitus** is a condition where blood glucose levels are abnormally high because either:
        - The body isn't making enough insulin, OR
        - The body can't properly use the insulin it makes

        In people with diabetes, blood glucose may:
        - Remain elevated for several hours after eating
        - Rise much higher after meals than in non-diabetics

        📚 To learn more about diabetes types, risk factors, and management, check out: https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/disease/diabetes/

        Would you like to know about hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) or other diabetes-related topics?

  utter_ask_fresh_over_frozen:
    - text: |
        "There is no evidence that says fresh food is better than frozen food as they are the same, one is just frozen to be preserved for long duration. Fresh food loses its nutrients faster that frozen food, hence it has to be consumed within a few days after it is harvested, while frozen food allows for a slightly longer shelf life before opening it or using it."


  utter_ask_processed_food:
    - text: |
        "No, processed food are actually healthy, like milk has to be processed to remove harmful bacteria so that it is safe for consumption, or to preserve food in tins and cans to make them last longer. However, what is unhealthy is ultra-processed food. These are the type of food that goes through more processing than other foods. They contain at least one if not more ingredients that are not commonly found in the kitchen. They were made to taste better rather than providing the vitamins and minerals that your body need. Some of them are, high-sugar level drinks, chips and even candies."

  utter_ask_gluten:
    - text: |
        "Gluten is a protein found in some grains like wheat, barley. Although in some media where it is perceived as unhealthy, it actually helps improve the health of the body, reducing the risk of health diseases. However, it can cause serious problems to some individuals that are allergic to wheat, or have celiac disease. Celiac disease is where the immune system reacts to gluten, and would sometimes affect the small intestine, reducing the amount of nutrients and minerals that can be absorbed into the bloodstream due to the change in shape of the vili, reducing the efficient absorption of nutrients and minerals. Some symptoms would then be stomach pain, nausea and vomiting. For long term health effects, there is a risk of health diseases."

        ⚠️ **What is Hypoglycemia?**

        While much attention goes to high blood sugar (hyperglycemia), there's also a condition of too LOW blood sugar called **hypoglycemia**.

        **Causes:**
        - Not eating enough food
        - Waiting too long between meals
        - Eating an imbalanced diet without enough carbohydrates
        - Exercising more intensely than usual
        - Taking insulin or certain medications
        - "Sugar crash" from eating too many refined carbs without protein/vegetables

        **Diagnosis:** Blood sugar level of 70 mg/dL or less

        **Mild to Moderate Symptoms:**
        - Shaking, sweating, dizziness
        - Irregular heart rates
        - Irritability, confusion

        **Treatment:** Quick-digesting carbohydrate such as:
        - 4 oz of juice or soda
        - Glucose tablets
        - 1 tablespoon of sugar or honey

        **Severe symptoms** (rare, mainly in type 1 diabetes with insulin use): seizures, unconsciousness, disorientation

        💡 Anyone with type 1 diabetes should wear a medical alert bracelet and consider keeping a glucagon emergency kit.



  utter_ask_carbohydrates:
  - text: |
      🌾 **What are Carbohydrates?**
      
      Carbohydrates are found in both healthy and unhealthy foods: bread, beans, milk, popcorn, potatoes, cookies, spaghetti, soft drinks, corn, and more. They come in various forms: **sugars, fibers, and starches**.
      
      **Why Carbs Matter:**
      Foods high in carbohydrates are an important part of a healthy diet! Carbs provide glucose, which is converted to energy for bodily functions and physical activity.
      
      ⚡ **Key Point:** Carbohydrate QUALITY is important—some types are better than others.
      
      **The Truth About Carbs:**
      ✅ Carbs are essential for energy
      ✅ They don't automatically cause weight gain
      ✅ The type and quality of carbs matter most
      
      Would you like to know about:
      - Healthy sources of carbohydrates
      - Unhealthy sources to limit
      - Tips for adding healthy carbs to your diet

  utter_ask_healthy_carbs:
  - text: |
      ✅ **Healthy Sources of Carbohydrates**
      
      The healthiest carb sources are **unprocessed or minimally processed**:
      
      🥗 **Vegetables** (except potatoes)
      - Leafy greens, broccoli, peppers, carrots
      - Provide vitamins, minerals, and fiber
      
      🍎 **Fruits**
      - Berries, apples, oranges, bananas
      - Deliver phytonutrients and natural sweetness
      
      🌾 **Whole Grains**
      - Brown rice, quinoa, oats, whole wheat
      - Barley, wheat berries
      
      🫘 **Beans & Legumes**
      - Lentils, chickpeas, black beans
      - Provide protein AND healthy carbs
      
      **The Healthy Eating Plate** recommends:
      - About **1/2 your plate**: vegetables and fruits
      - About **1/4 your plate**: whole grains
      
      These foods deliver vitamins, minerals, fiber, and important phytonutrients that promote good health!

  utter_ask_unhealthy_carbs:
  - text: |
      ⚠️ **Unhealthy Sources of Carbohydrates**
      
      These refined and processed foods should be limited:
      
      🚫 **White bread and pasta**
      🚫 **Pastries and baked goods**
      🚫 **Sodas and sugary drinks**
      🚫 **Candy and sweets**
      🚫 **Highly processed or refined foods**
      
      **Why limit these?**
      These contain easily digested carbohydrates that may:
      - Contribute to weight gain
      - Interfere with weight loss efforts
      - Promote diabetes and heart disease
      - Cause rapid blood sugar spikes and crashes
      
      💡 **Better Strategy:** Replace these with whole grain alternatives and pair carbs with protein and healthy fats to slow digestion and stabilize blood sugar.

  utter_ask_add_healthy_carbs:
  - text: |
      💡 **How to Add Healthy Carbs to Your Diet**
      
      **1. Start the day with whole grains**
      - Try steel cut or old fashioned oats (not instant)
      - Choose cereals with at least 4g fiber and less than 8g sugar per serving
      
      **2. Use whole grain breads**
      - Look for "whole wheat" or "whole grain" as FIRST ingredient
      - Best: 100% whole wheat bread
      
      **3. Look beyond the bread aisle**
      - Whole wheat bread is often finely ground and high in sodium
      - Try whole grains in salad form: brown rice, quinoa
      
      **4. Choose whole fruit instead of juice**
      - An orange has 2x the fiber and 1/2 the sugar of 12 oz orange juice
      - You get more nutrients and feel fuller longer
      
      **5. Pass on potatoes, bring on the beans**
      - Potatoes promote weight gain
      - Beans provide slowly digested carbs + protein
      - Try chickpeas, lentils, black beans
      
      🎯 Small swaps make a big difference over time!

      🍽️ **Building a Healthy Diet**
      
      Use the **Healthy Eating Plate** as your guide for balanced meals:
      
      **🥗 Vegetables & Fruits – ½ of your plate**
      - Aim for color and variety
      - Note: Potatoes don't count due to blood sugar impact
      
      **🌾 Whole Grains – ¼ of your plate**
      - Whole wheat, barley, quinoa, oats, brown rice
      - Milder effect on blood sugar than white/refined grains
      
      **🍗 Protein – ¼ of your plate**
      - Fish, poultry, beans, nuts
      - Limit red meat, avoid processed meats

      📏 **About Portion Sizes on the Healthy Eating Plate**
      
      The section sizes are **NOT** based on calories or specific servings!
      
      ✨ **What they represent:**
      The relative sizes suggest approximate PROPORTIONS of each food group for a healthy plate.
      
      **Why not specific amounts?**
      Because individual needs vary based on:
      - Age
      - Gender
      - Body size
      - Level of physical activity
      - Metabolism
      - Health goals
      
      💡 **The key takeaway:** Use the plate as a visual guide for balance, not a strict calorie calculator. Adjust amounts based on your personal needs while maintaining these healthy proportions.

      🤔 **Why Other People's Diets May Not Work for You**
      
      This is a common question! Here's the truth:
      
      **Individual Differences Matter:**
      Even if a diet works for someone else, it may not work for you due to:
      - Genetic differences
      - Lifestyle factors
      - Personal preferences
      - Metabolic variations
      - Health conditions
      
      **Evidence-Based Principles:**
      ✅ Calories matter for weight management
      ✅ Food QUALITY is equally important
      ✅ Diets work best when they're easy to follow
      ✅ Tailoring to YOUR lifestyle is key
      
      **Bottom Line:**
      There's no one-size-fits-all diet! Success comes from finding an eating pattern that:
      - Fits your preferences
      - Works with your lifestyle
      - Provides proper nutrition
      - Is sustainable long-term
      
      💡 Consider consulting a registered dietitian for personalized guidance based on your health profile, lifestyle, and preferences.

      💪 **What is Protein?**
      
      Protein is found throughout your body—in muscle, bone, skin, hair, and virtually every tissue!
      
      **What Protein Does:**
      - Makes up enzymes that power chemical reactions
      - Forms hemoglobin that carries oxygen in blood
      - Builds and repairs tissues
      - Supports immune function
      
      **Fun Fact:** At least 10,000 different proteins make you what you are!
      
      **Building Blocks:**
      Protein is made from 20+ amino acids. Our bodies make some, but 9 **essential amino acids** MUST come from food:
      - Histidine, Isoleucine, Leucine
      - Lysine, Methionine, Phenylalanine
      - Threonine, Tryptophan, Valine
      
      Since we don't store amino acids, we need consistent protein intake through diet.
      
      Would you like to know how much protein you need daily?

  utter_ask_protein_needs:
  - text: |
      🎯 **How Much Protein Do You Need?**
      
      **National Academy of Medicine Recommendations:**
      Adults need a minimum of **0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day**
      
      Or: **Just over 7 grams for every 20 pounds**
      
      **Examples:**
      - **140-pound person:** ~50 grams of protein/day
      - **200-pound person:** ~70 grams of protein/day
      
      **Acceptable Range:**
      10-35% of daily calories can come from protein
      
      **Individual Factors Affect Needs:**
      - Age
      - Exercise level
      - Health conditions
      - Overall dietary pattern
      - Muscle-building goals
      
      **Important Finding:**
      Harvard research on 130,000+ people over 32 years found that total protein percentage wasn't related to mortality, BUT the **SOURCE of protein mattered significantly!**
      
      💡 Choose quality protein sources: fish, poultry, beans, nuts, eggs

  utter_debunk_carbs_myth:
  - text: |
      🔍 **MYTH vs. REALITY: Carbs and Weight Gain**
      
      ❌ **MYTH:** "Carbs always lead to weight gain"
      
      ✅ **TRUTH:** Carbohydrates are essential for energy! Weight gain occurs from excess CALORIES, not carbs specifically. Whole grain carbs provide fiber, vitamins, and sustained energy.
      
      📚 **Evidence:** 
      Research shows populations consuming high amounts of whole grains (like Mediterranean diets) have LOWER obesity rates. The QUALITY and QUANTITY of carbs matter more than avoiding them entirely.
      
      💡 **Practical Tips:**
      1. Choose whole grains over reffdabilize blood sugar
      3. Watch portion sizes
      4. Focus on fiber-rich options like oats, quinoa, brown rice
      
      🎯 **Bottom Line:** Don't fear carbs—choose the right ones!

  utter_debunk_detox_myth:
  - text: |
      🔍 **MYTH vs. REALITY: Detox Teas & Cleanses**
      
      ❌ **MYTH:** "Detox teas and cleanses remove toxins from your body"
      
      ✅ **TRUTH:** Your liver and kidneys naturally detoxify your body 24/7! Commercial detox products don't enhance this process and may cause dehydration or nutrient deficiencies.
      
      📚 **Evidence:**
      Medical studies show NO evidence that detox products improve organ function. Some can be harmful, causing:
      - Electrolyte imbalances
      - Dehydration
      - Interference with medications
      - Nutrient deficiencies
      
      💡 **What ACTUALLY Supports Detox:**
      1. Stay hydrated with water
      2. Eat fiber-rich foods (fruits, vegetables, whole grains)
      3. Support liver health with vegetables
      4. Get adequate sleep
      
      🎯 **Bottom Line:** Save your money! Your body already has excellent detox systems.

  utter_debunk_fat_myth:
  - text: |
      🔍 **MYTH vs. REALITY: Dietary Fats**
      
      ❌ **MYTH:** "All fats are bad and make you fat"
      
      ✅ **TRUTH:** Healthy fats are ESSENTIAL for hormone production, brain function, and vitamin absorption! They don't directly cause weight gain when consumed in appropriate amounts.
      
      📚 **Evidence:**
      Studies show diets rich in unsaturated fats (like the Mediterranean diet) improve heart health and can actually aid weight management. Your body NEEDS fats for optimal function!
      
      💡 **Smart Fat Choices:**
      1. Choose olive oil, avocados, nuts, seeds
      2. Include omega-3 fatty acids (fish, walnuts, flaxseed)
      3. LIMIT trans fats and highly processed oils
      4. Balance fat intake with activity level
      
      🎯 **Bottom Line:** Focus on fat QUALITY, not elimination!

  utter_debunk_breakfast_myth:
  - text: |
      🔍 **MYTH vs. REALITY: Breakfast & Metabolism**
      
      ❌ **MYTH:** "Skipping breakfast ruins your metabolism"
      
      ✅ **TRUTH:** Meal timing is less important than total daily nutrition. Some people thrive with breakfast, others do well with intermittent fasting. It's individual!
      
      📚 **Evidence:**
      Research shows metabolism is more affected by TOTAL calorie intake and physical activity than meal timing. What matters most is listening to your body's genuine hunger cues.
      
      💡 **Healthy Eating Tips:**
      1. Eat when genuinely hungry
      2. Focus on meal QUALITY over timing
      3. Stay consistent with eating patterns
      4. Prioritize nutrient-dense foods
      
      🎯 **Bottom Line:** If you're hungry in the morning, eat! If not, that's okay too. There's no universal rule.

  utter_debunk_protein_myth:
  - text: |
      🔍 **MYTH vs. REALITY: Protein & Muscle Building**
      
      ❌ **MYTH:** "You need massive amounts of protein to build muscle"
      
      ✅ **TRUTH:** Most people need 0.8-1.2g protein per kg body weight. Athletes may need up to 2g/kg. Excess protein doesn't equal more muscle!
      
      📚 **Evidence:**
      Studies show protein needs plateau at moderate levels. Exercise stimulus and recovery matter MORE than extreme protein intake for muscle growth.
      
      💡 **Smart Protein Strategy:**
      1. Spread protein throughout the day (not all at once)
      2. Include variety of sources (animal + plant)
      3. Time protein around workouts for recovery
      4. Don't neglect carbs and fats—they're crucial too!
      
      🎯 **Bottom Line:** More protein ≠ more muscle. Focus on adequate protein + proper training + recovery.

  utter_debunk_sugar_myth:
  - text: |
      🔍 **MYTH vs. REALITY: Sugar**
      
      ❌ **MYTH:** "Sugar is toxic and should be completely eliminated"
      
      ✅ **TRUTH:** While excess ADDED sugar is problematic, natural sugars in fruits provide nutrients and fiber. Complete elimination isn't necessary for health!
      
      📚 **Evidence:**
      Research distinguishes between added sugars and naturally occurring sugars. Fruit consumption is associated with BETTER health outcomes despite sugar content.
      
      💡 **Balanced Approach:**
      1. LIMIT added sugars (sodas, candy, baked goods)
      2. Enjoy fruit without guilt—it comes with fiber and nutrients
      3. Read nutrition labels for hidden added sugars
      4. Choose whole foods over processed options
      
      🎯 **Bottom Line:** Focus on reducing ADDED sugars, not eliminating all sugars. An apple is healthy, even though it contains sugar!

  utter_debunk_organic_myth:
  - text: |
      🔍 **MYTH vs. REALITY: Organic Food**
      
      ❌ **MYTH:** "Organic food is always more nutritious"
      
      ✅ **TRUTH:** Organic foods may have fewer pesticides, but nutritional differences are minimal. Eating more produce (organic OR conventional) is what matters most!
      
      📚 **Evidence:**
      Large-scale reviews show similar nutrient profiles between organic and conventional produce. The health benefits of eating fruits and vegetables FAR OUTWEIGH organic vs. conventional concerns.
      
      💡 **Smart Shopping Tips:**
      1. Prioritize produce VARIETY over organic labels
      2. Wash all produce thoroughly
      3. Focus on eating MORE vegetables and fruits
      4. Buy organic for personal preference, not nutritional necessity
      
      🎯 **Bottom Line:** Don't skip vegetables because they're not organic! Conventional produce is still incredibly healthy.

  utter_ask_weight_loss:
  - text: |
      🎯 **Evidence-Based Weight Loss Principles**
      
      **1. Calorie Balance**
      Weight loss occurs when you consume fewer calories than you burn. Focus on sustainable deficits (300-500 calories/day).
      
      **2. Nutrient Density**
      Choose foods high in nutrients but moderate in calories:
      - Vegetables and fruits
      - Lean proteins (fish, chicken, beans)
      - Whole grains
      
      **3. Consistency Over Perfection**
      Small, sustainable changes work better than extreme diets that are hard to maintain.
      
      **4. Include All Food Groups**
      Restrictive diets often fail long-term. Balance is key for sustainability.
      
      **5. Stay Active**
      Combine nutrition changes with regular physical activity.
      
      💡 **Remember:** Quick fixes rarely work. Sustainable lifestyle changes lead to lasting results!

  utter_ask_supplements:
  - text: |
      💊 **Supplements: What You Should Know**
      
      Most people can get nutrients from food, but supplements may help if you:
      
      ✅ Have diagnosed deficiencies (confirmed by blood work)
      ✅ Are pregnant or breastfeeding
      ✅ Have restricted diets (vegan, food allergies)
      ✅ Have certain medical conditions
      
      ⚠️ **Important Warnings:**
      - More isn't always better—excess vitamins can be HARMFUL
      - Get blood work done BEFORE supplementing
      - Supplements can interact with medications
      - Quality varies widely between brands
      
      💡 **Evidence-Based Advice:**
      Focus on getting nutrients from whole foods first. Supplements are meant to "supplement" a healthy diet, not replace it!
      
      Are you concerned about a specific nutrient or considering a particular supplement?
